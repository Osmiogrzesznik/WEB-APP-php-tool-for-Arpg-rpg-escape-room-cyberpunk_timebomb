TODO: reset clocks after fetching update!!!!



TODO: tick send location in registration form




TODO:  during registration - if real connection ip is different than 
	ip being registered - save location. Admin being in the field setting up a device
	would already take care of clicking prompt ,
	allowing device to share it's location 
	and would already  provide its first location point 


TODO: checking for $session existing piror to checking if is registered device
	MAYBE JUST SANITY CHECK : IF DEVICE HAS SESSION AND IS NOT PRESENT IN DB JUST DESTROY SESSION?
        // CHECK IF USABLE IN device_session_id process

TODO: ask tomek to test

TODO: remaining attempts?
TODO: what if two users try to register the same ip address as their bombs?
TODO: deviceregistration should allow to set time "from now" (just minutes)
	ViewAddTODEvics.php input field and js calculation to set the date in the form each time (just minutes)
	TODO: device update
    this one may be a bit dodgy. Cannot use CHeckDeviceRegistrationData as  it is? 
    need to be done in POST and if reuse it POST will need to provide:
             newPassword, repeat password and so on
       if update would use its own function/method:
        again same problem a lot of code to check if any value differs / either on js side or php-wise
    TODO - make clock beep faster at the end PROBLEM:SOUNDS ARE LOST)
TODO:display feedback in red border
       
TODO: on each touch ? NO - PASSWORD ATTEMPT
 listener should remember 
the two timestamps, one get from db , and one registered
 on each touch of window. 
setInterval function should be active: 
    check if lasttouchtimestamp 
    is not null and if it is different from currently 
    hold in js memory DBtimestamp(not fetched from DB)    

TODO modify scripts so they are proper js classes or constructor functions
	DONE ClockController.js
	TODO touchKeyboard.js

TODO - clock controller should create its components on its own
user just creates counterCNT'ainer

DONE not users (there may be few users on the same computer)




DONE in php Todo:: device deletion in VoewAll
    DONE TODO: provide UI element in HTML for deletion and secure with confirmation
   TODO: checl session destroy on deletion?
     if device doesnt exist in db when requesting password or sending update status js should react

dodaj do sql ilosc prob i max ilosc , zrob w php update do tego 
w createnewdevice  i reszcie method
potem zrob link userId to device


if user logged in and action= allDevices
   adchuj tyljko tabelke w htmlu albo jsonie w htmlu
 NIE zapomnij zabronic dostepu do pla.php przed produkcja

admin cannot log back in on the device that was registered as a bomb
    is it ok ? I think it is  another layer of security. try action=Register (user)q)
register register Słoń Trąbalski nie działa r
egulacja rejestracja działa rejestracja nie daziala z urzadzen 
ktore sajuz zapisane w bazie


 - every Time somebody sees a table with all devices status 
active inactive should be treated as ARmed , disarmed
 find some way to address these cells and update them in inline js.
maybe try dataset in conjuction with class=" updateAbledate"

TODO:

ctive as understood by "being recently touched" should be
 calculated automatically based on the last
 updated date. already in js showalldevices could actively
poll every minute or 30 sec to fetch lastUpdated 
Timestamp 
    js would constantly calculate difference between Date.now
    and value in table to show how long ago somebody was touching
    the bomb
    

try not to do $result->fetch 
call method on QUERY pdo object
maybe execute returns just bool



DONE:- modified index.php to react to action=registerDevice POST and 
	to add device to DB checking all input.

DONE  display all devices in a table if user is logged in
	-when device just added (show logged in)
	 later  -> WHERE user_creator_id = :logged_user_id in showalldevices to allow many users to have separate bombsets


Done TODO : rewrite mechanism of clock to be interested only in showing countdown to given date
      



        


DONE -create registration of device
	try to copy user registration mechanism but with ip's instead of username password
	if device not registered 2 options: give your admin cred's and device
	DO not save ip in db if user-(Admin) is not logged in 
	if device is registered automatically should become logged in ---COMPLETE 
	6 states connecting device:  (logged = !empty$SESSION) 
								(registered = logged every bomb immediately automatically logs in )
			1		user not logged and device not registered not logged -> user registration or login
			2		user logged and device not registered not logged -> user choice should this device be 
						bomb or admin panel
			3		user not logged and device registered as bomb-> interface bomb
			4		user logged and device registered as bomb-> ?
			5		user not logged and device registered as admin panel -> login
			6		user logged and device registered as admin panel -> admin

	if device is registered as a bomb after user used it to log in user should be logged out
	each user chooses ip which serves as his administration panel

	IDEA: user should not require to go to device to activate it as bomb
		every time device connects it is already stored in db
		user chooses in db which to activate
		PROBLEMS: polling needed  and maybe a lot of problems with separate paths for all this ajax post requests 

DONE: !!!!TODO: deactivate device if correct password entered, do not activate if disarmed;
DONE Javascript in add to devices still shows 2hours for bomb set in 1 hour ROUNDING ERROR !!!
DONE: TODO: display time last active as 5 min ago 
DONE: DISPLAY clock in the background when registering
DONE`****TODO: remove email - not needed
DONE**TODO: user can delete his account with all devices with it
DONE TODO: not possible for admin to login in any way whe device is set even changing ip in get (possible action=logout&ip=differentthananyregistereddevice)
DONE TODO: now register post doesnt work ?
DONE TODO: display confirmation dialog when user clicks deleteme
DONE TODO : tidy up - do not display everything doubled and so on views
DONe TODO: do not use js script requested as fiel
	instead fetch it as JSON object no password just length
	and isNumerical
DONE TODO: create instance of clock for each digits-small
DONE WIP --- TODO: user timezone is saved to db now make it retrieved for user and devices eachtime
 //********* change to not null in db and install.sql */
        // echo "<pre>";
        //             print_r($_POST);

        //             exit();

DONE TODO: user have to choose timezone
	register - auto-dropdown timezones on user register
	index.php - set timezone to user selected timezone 


DONE ***		implement action=superuser which will simply redirect to login page;
Made login and registration look nicer
DONE valid location doesnt change back to no location if there was no location in get during checkups 
	now always last location remains if it was valid only new digits will be updated
DONE what if mobile device will move and its address wil change? 
	Save cookie with device ID or session ID or random 
		generated string saved in db or for now just device name 
		DONE save cookie on create
			what if no cookie on the device but it is registered(e.g.different browser opened)
			set cookie when retrieved device by using ip?
	in ONEFILEAPPLICATion::IsDeviceRegistered():
		query db Select ... where device_ip = :connection_ip OR device_name = :device_name_from_cookie
		 if ip doesnt match but the ID or device name above do
		 	update ip in DB and proceed
	-> above will result in access to login by GET setting ip=123 removed 
	notes: don not forget to class declare 
	$time_set_timestamp
	$device_session_id
	$device_id
	do not forgetto check db queries - they where made as if ip was more important 
		SEARCHFILE device_ip or ip
DONE added map OpenStreemap to show every device on the map simply said

DONE: 
TODO: implement map with pointers it is possible
https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.44255&mlon=-1.49471#map=19/52.44255/-1.49471
