- PROBLEMS : install.sql/php doeas NOT create device table even thoug sql statements are there
- test timebombsettings.php retrieval by creating registered device in db and setting all fields

-- created device settings retrieval php script that outputs js script  with settings data


-create registration of device
	try to copy user registration mechanism but with ip's instead of username password
	if device not registered 2 options: give your admin cred's and device
	DO not save ip in db if user is not logged in
	if device registered automatically should become logged in ---COMPLETE 
	6 states connecting device:  (logged = !empty$SESSION) 
								(registered = logged every bomb immediately automatically logs in )
			1		user not logged and device not registered not logged -> user registration or login
			2		user logged and device not registered not logged -> user choice should this device be 
						bomb or admin panel
			3		user not logged and device registered as bomb-> interface bomb
			4		user logged and device registered as bomb-> ?
			5		user not logged and device registered as admin panel -> login
			6		user logged and device registered as admin panel -> admin

	if device is registered as a bomb after user used it to log in user should be logged out
	each user chooses ip which serves as his administration panel

	IDEA: user should not require to go to device to activate it as bomb
		every time device connects it is already stored in db
		user chooses in db which to activate
		PROBLEMS: polling needed  and maybe a lot of problems with separate paths for all this ajax post requests
